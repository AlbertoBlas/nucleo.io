## About:

ActionScript /Flex Library containing 2 projects at the moment:


### Dependency Injection framework with code generation:
The Dependency Injection framework use a code generation solution to provide DI without using reflection.
It is based on the [as3-commons-jasblocks](https://github.com/teotigraphix/as3-commons-jasblocks) project
which is using [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/).

The code generation is currently beta version and needs some more work to get bulletproof and ready for use in
production.

More information can be found at the [nucleo.io blog](http://nucleo.io)


### Scheduler micro-framework:
The scheduler micro-framework can be used for easily configuring tasks to be
executed in sequence, parallel or based on their data dependencies.
