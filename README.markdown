# nucleo.io - ActionScript / Flex Library


## About:

nucleo.io is an ActionScript /Flex Library:

### Scheduler micro-framework:
The scheduler micro-framework can be used for easily configuring tasks to be
executed in sequence, parallel or based on their data dependencies.

### Dependency Injection framework:
The Dependency Injection framework use a code generation solution to provide DI without using reflection.
It is based on the [as3-commons-jasblocks](https://github.com/teotigraphix/as3-commons-jasblocks) project
which is based on [antlr](http://www.antlr.org/).

The code generation is currently in an experimental state and needs some more work to get bulletproof.
